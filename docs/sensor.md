### Summary of Functional Enhancements in sensor.py v0.4.0 vs. sensor.py v.0.3.8

The sensor.py version 0.4.0 introduces several functional enhancements over sensor.py v0.3.8, reflecting a refactoring effort to streamline functionality and improve robustness:

- **Simplified Sensor Support**:
  - sensor.py focuses solely on power and energy sensors for rooms, removing support for humidity and rocker sensors present in sensor.py v0.3.8 since a rocker and humidity sensors do not have state values. This reflects a shift in requirements and a decision to streamline the integration.
- **Reactive State Updates with RxPy**:
  - Replaces event listeners with RxPy subscriptions for state updates, enabling a more reactive and more efficient approach to handling room state changes.
- **Robust State Access**:
  - Introduces the _safe_get function to safely and consistently retrieve state values from sensors, accommodating different state representations (e.g., attributes or dictionaries) and enhancing code reliability.
- **Improved Resource Management**:
  - Adds async_will_remove_from_hass to dispose of RxPy subscriptions when entities are removed, preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper resource cleanup.

These enhancements are a deliberate effort to refine the sensor integration, focusing on core functionality (power and energy monitoring) while adopting modern reactive programming techniques and improving code stability.
