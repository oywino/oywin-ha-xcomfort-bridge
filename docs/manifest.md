Brief summary of the functional enhancements in the new manifest:
• It realigns your integration with the official ha-xcomfort-bridge repo (cleaner URLs). 
• It switches to your experimental fork of the Python library, so you can pull in new features/fixes before they land upstream. 
• It updates the maintainers list to reflect current code ownership. Together, these tweaks streamline project governance, documentation, and let you test the latest xComfort-Python enhancements.

The new manifest represents a maturation of the project with improved dependency management (moving away from experimental code), repository consolidation under a new URL structure, and expanded maintainer support. The core functionality remains the same, but the foundation is more stable and better organized for long-term maintenance.
