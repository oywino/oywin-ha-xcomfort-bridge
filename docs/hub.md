Functional Enhancements in hub.py vewrsion 0.4.0 vs hub.py version 0.3.8:

The `hub.py` version 0.4.0 introduces significant functional enhancements over `hub.py` version 0.3.8, primarily focused on improving resource management, event handling, and overall stability of the xComfort bridge communication within Home Assistant.

Key enhancements include:

1. **Robust Subscription Management**: The most critical improvement is the introduction of explicit subscription tracking. `hub.py` v0.4.0 now uses `_device_subscriptions` and `_room_subscriptions` dictionaries to store unsubscribe callbacks. This allows for proper management and cleanup of subscriptions, preventing potential memory leaks and ensuring that resources are released when no longer needed.

2. **Dedicated `clear_subscriptions` Method**: A new `clear_subscriptions` method has been added. This method centralizes the logic for disposing of all active device and room subscriptions. It iterates through the stored unsubscribe callbacks and calls them, ensuring a clean state.

3. **Enhanced `stop` Method**: The `stop` method now calls `self.clear_subscriptions()`. This ensures that all active subscriptions are properly terminated when the hub is stopped, contributing to better resource management and preventing orphaned connections.

4. **Improved `load_devices` Logic**: The `load_devices` method now begins by calling `self.clear_subscriptions()`, ensuring that any existing subscriptions are cleaned up before new ones are established. Furthermore, it includes logic to prevent duplicate subscriptions for the same device or room ID, making the subscription process more robust.

5. **Refined `__init__` Method**: The `__init__` method now initializes `self.rooms = []` to ensure the attribute always exists. It also uses a more concise way to set the `identifier` (`self.identifier = identifier or ip`).

6. **Simplified `_fire_event` Logic**: The `_fire_event` method in `hub.py` v0.4.0 no longer explicitly filters out `BridgeDevice` events, suggesting a more streamlined event processing approach where all relevant events are now passed through the Home Assistant event bus.

7. **Enhanced Logging**: Additional `_LOGGER.info` statements have been added in `load_devices` to provide more detailed information about the subscription process, including raw device and room updates, which is valuable for debugging and monitoring.

In summary, the changes in `hub.py` v0.4.0 significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the xComfort integration by implementing a more structured and robust approach to managing event subscriptions and resource cleanup.
